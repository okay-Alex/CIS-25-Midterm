# CIS-25-Midterm

# Functions

### float calculateArea
I declared two float operands, and then returned their product.

### bool isPrime
I checked a variety of base cases, before I used a for loop to itterate through all numbers ranging from 3 to the input number to check if they were a factor.

# Loops And Arrays

### Even Numbers from 1-50
To print out all even numbers, I itterated from 1 - 50 using a for loop, and used the remainder from modulus to check if a number was even before printing.

### 10 Input Numbers
I created an array with a fixed size of 10, and then used a while loop to get 10 user inputs, before printing them all out with a for loop from the array.

# CIN And Variables

### Username and Favorite Number
I declared two variables to store the username and a favorite number, then I used cin to get inputs for both before combining them into one output string.

### Different Variable Types
I created variables with the following types: int, bool, string, char, and float, and then I printed them out.

# Logical Operators and Nested If Statements (Two Files)

### Leap Year
I got the input year using cin, and then the code checks to see if the remainder from year modulo 4 is 0, and if it is, then that year is a leap year.

### Nested If Statements
I got three input floats using cin, and then I used nested if-else statements to check to see which one was the largest

# Switch Case
I got three user inputs, two floats, and a char operator, and the used a switch case with 4 cases to apply the correct operation.


# Debugging
I fixed the logical operator from = to ==, and fixes syntax errors like the missing curly brackets for a block of code.
